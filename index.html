      <h1>Your Prescription for a Perfect Getaway</h1>
      <p>
        Travel as a form of wellness. We acts as a personal "travel doctor,"
        diagnosing a client's specific needs and prescribing a curated,
        wellness-focused trip.<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Clients identify their travel "ailment" => We generate a personalized
        travel prescription a detailed itinerary designed to rejuvenate their
        mind, body, and spirit.<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Each prescription comes with a full "treatment plan," including packing
        tips, cultural guides, and wellness activities to ensure a seamless and
        enriching journey.<br />
      </p>

        rested, but genuinely transformed and able to carry the benefits of
        their trip into their daily life.
