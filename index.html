    <h1>Your Prescription for a Perfect Getaway</h1>
    <p>
      Travel as a form of wellness. We are a travel recommendation
      company that acts as a personal "travel doctor," diagnosing a client's
      specific needs and prescribing a curated, wellness-focused trip.<br />
    </p>
    <h2>Core Offerings:</h2>
    <p>
      - Diagnosis & Prescription: Clients complete a brief questionnaire to
      identify their travel "ailment" (e.g., burnout, need for adventure, desire
      for connection). We then generate a personalized travel prescription
      a detailed itinerary designed to rejuvenate their mind, body, and spirit.<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      - Comprehensive Guides: Each prescription comes with a full "treatment
      plan," including packing tips, cultural guides, and wellness activities to
      ensure a seamless and enriching journey.<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Expert Curation: Our recommendations are meticulously vetted by a team of
      travel and wellness experts, prioritizing quality and genuine benefit over
      a generic list of destinations.
    </p>
    <h2>Key Differentiators:</h2>
    <p>
      - Holistic & Personalized: We move beyond traditional travel planning by
      integrating wellness principles into every step. We don't offer
      one-size-fits-all trips; we create a bespoke experience tailored to the
      individual. <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      - Focus on Transformation: Our goal is for clients to return not just
      rested, but genuinely transformed and able to carry the benefits of their
      trip into their daily life.
